# Final-Project-Tableau

This project used data collected over the pass 40 years on real estate in Canada to provide insights.

## Project/Goals

This project shows insights on the real estate sector across Canada. You will find interesting analysis that covers the last 40 years.  Two relevant parameters are used to quantify the value of the constructions involving on this market. 
	
    1 - The HPI that stands for House Price Index
	2 - The Price that is the financial value
	
The price is too elastic over long period that is why the HPI is mostly used in long term analysis.  Itâ€™s more robust against fluctuations and provide stability when forecasting.

## Process

### (your step 1)
    Clean and analyse the data
### (your step 2)
    Understand the purpose of the data to deliver insights
### (your step 3)
    Vsualize interesting patterns found
### (your step 4)
    Explain those patterns and why they are useful

## Results

Option 1 and insights are provided following the fishbone bellow

1 - Trend of house prices over the last 40 years.
